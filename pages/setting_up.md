#Setting it up

Setting up the TAF framework is as simple as setting up any other 3rd paty libraries like TestNG, Junit or Selenium etc.
Just download the jar present under download section and add as a dependency in your project.

You have to add a TAF configuration file named "taf.properties" to the folder "src/test/resources" under your automation projet.
